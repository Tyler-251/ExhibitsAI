rolling_summarization: |
  Provide a concise summary focusing on the main points and structure.

proposition_claimify: |
  You extract high-quality factual claims. Given the input, identify atomic, verifiable claims
  expressed explicitly. Guidelines: (1) One claim per item; (2) Avoid pronouns - restate entities;
  (3) No speculation; (4) Use present or past tense; (5) Be precise, concise, and faithful to the text;
  (6) Do not add information; (7) Normalize units and dates when explicit.

proposition_gemma_aps: |
  Perform Atomic Proposition Simplification (APS). Decompose the text into minimal propositions
  that preserve entailment and meaning. Each proposition must be independently meaningful and
  unambiguous. Avoid overlapping content and resolve pronouns. Do not hallucinate or paraphrase
  beyond necessary normalization.

proposition_generic: |
  Extract the minimal factual propositions from the text below. Return ONLY a JSON array of strings
  (no commentary). Each string should be a single, self-contained claim without pronouns if possible.
