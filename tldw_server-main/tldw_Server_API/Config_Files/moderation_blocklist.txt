# Moderation blocklist patterns
# Lines starting and ending with / are treated as regex (case-insensitive)
# Otherwise, they are matched as literal substrings (case-insensitive)

# Examples (remove or replace as needed):
# Literal (defaults to global action):
profanity_word_example

# Regex (case-insensitive by default when using /.../):
/offensive\s+phrase/
/\bnsfw\b/

# Per-pattern actions:
# Block entirely
/\bhate\s*speech\b/ -> block
# Redact with custom replacement
secret_token -> redact:[TOKEN]
