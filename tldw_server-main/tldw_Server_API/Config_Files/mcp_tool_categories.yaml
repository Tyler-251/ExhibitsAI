# Sample tool → category mapping for MCP per-tool rate limits
#
# Categories are arbitrary strings; this project recognizes at least:
#   - ingestion: write/expensive operations (e.g., ingest, update, delete)
#   - read: read-only/retrieval operations
#
# You can override or extend categories as needed.
