# Evaluations User Guide - For End Users

## What Are Evaluations?

Evaluations help you measure the quality of AI-generated content like summaries, answers, and responses. Think of it as a grading system for AI - you can check if your AI is producing accurate, relevant, and well-written content.

## Getting Started

### What You Need
- Access to tldw_server (usually at `http://localhost:8000`)
- Your content to evaluate (text, summaries, Q&A pairs)
- (Optional) API key for AI providers like OpenAI or Anthropic

### Your First Evaluation in 3 Steps

**Step 1: Prepare Your Content**
You need two things:
- The original content (article, document, question)
- The AI-generated response (summary, answer)

**Step 2: Choose an Evaluation Type**
- **Summary Quality**: Use G-Eval for summaries
- **Q&A Quality**: Use RAG evaluation for question-answering
- **General Quality**: Use response quality evaluation

**Step 3: Run the Evaluation**
Send your content to the evaluation endpoint and get quality scores back.

## Types of Evaluations

### 1. G-Eval - For Summaries 📝

**What it does**: Grades summaries on four aspects:
- **Fluency** (1-3): Is it well-written?
- **Consistency** (1-5): Does it match the original facts?
- **Relevance** (1-5): Does it include important points?
- **Coherence** (1-5): Is it well-organized?

**When to use**:
- Testing article summaries
- Evaluating meeting notes
- Checking document abstracts

**Example Score Interpretation**:
```
Fluency: 2.8/3 (Excellent grammar)
Consistency: 4.5/5 (Very accurate)
Relevance: 3.8/5 (Good, but missed some points)
Coherence: 4.2/5 (Well structured)
Overall: 82% - Good quality summary
```

### 2. RAG Evaluation - For Q&A Systems 🤖

**What it does**: Evaluates how well an AI answers questions using retrieved information.

**Metrics**:
- **Relevance**: Does the answer address the question?
- **Faithfulness**: Is it accurate to the source material?
- **Answer Similarity**: How close to the ideal answer?

**When to use**:
- Testing chatbots
- Evaluating search results
- Checking FAQ systems

### 3. Response Quality - For General Content ✍️

**What it does**: Checks if responses meet your specific requirements.

**Custom Criteria Examples**:
- Tone (professional, friendly, casual)
- Completeness (all points covered)
- Format (follows template)
- Accuracy (factually correct)

**When to use**:
- Email generation
- Content creation
- Customer service responses

## Step-by-Step Tutorials

### Tutorial 1: Evaluating an Article Summary

**Scenario**: You have an AI-generated summary of a news article and want to check its quality.

**Step 1: Prepare Your Data**
```
Original Article: "Climate change is affecting global weather patterns..."
AI Summary: "Climate change impacts weather worldwide..."
```

**Step 2: Send for Evaluation**

Using a simple web interface or tool:
```json
{
  "source_text": "Your full article text here...",
  "summary": "Your AI-generated summary here...",
  "api_name": "openai"
}
```

**Step 3: Interpret Results**
```
Results:
- Fluency: 85% (Well written)
- Consistency: 92% (Factually accurate)
- Relevance: 78% (Covered main points)
- Coherence: 88% (Good flow)

Overall Score: 86% - High Quality Summary ✓
```

### Tutorial 2: Testing Chatbot Responses

**Scenario**: Your chatbot answered a customer question, and you want to verify quality.

**Step 1: Collect the Information**
```
Question: "How do I reset my password?"
Context: [Your help documentation]
Bot Answer: "To reset your password, go to settings..."
```

**Step 2: Run RAG Evaluation**
```json
{
  "query": "How do I reset my password?",
  "retrieved_contexts": ["From help docs: Password reset steps..."],
  "generated_response": "To reset your password, go to settings..."
}
```

**Step 3: Review Scores**
```
Relevance: 95% - Directly answers the question
Faithfulness: 88% - Accurate to documentation
Overall: Excellent response quality
```

### Tutorial 3: Batch Evaluation for Multiple Items

**Scenario**: You have 10 summaries to evaluate at once.

**Step 1: Prepare Batch**
```json
{
  "evaluation_type": "geval",
  "items": [
    {"source_text": "Article 1", "summary": "Summary 1"},
    {"source_text": "Article 2", "summary": "Summary 2"},
    // ... more items
  ]
}
```

**Step 2: Run Batch Evaluation**
The system will evaluate all items in parallel.

**Step 3: Review Batch Results**
```
Batch Results:
- Total Items: 10
- Average Score: 84%
- Best: Item #3 (92%)
- Needs Improvement: Item #7 (68%)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "Rate limit exceeded"
**Problem**: Too many requests too quickly.
**Solution**:
- Wait 60 seconds before retrying
- Use batch evaluation for multiple items
- Spread requests over time

#### "Low scores across all evaluations"
**Problem**: Systematic quality issues.
**Check**:
- Is the source content clear?
- Are you using appropriate prompts?
- Is the model suitable for this task?

#### "Inconsistent scores for same content"
**Problem**: Evaluation variability.
**Solution**:
- Run multiple evaluations and average
- Use temperature=0 for consistency
- Check for time-of-day effects

#### "Evaluation takes too long"
**Problem**: Performance issues.
**Try**:
- Reduce text length
- Use batch processing
- Check server resources

## Cost Considerations

### Typical Costs per Evaluation

| Provider | Per Evaluation | 1000 Evaluations |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| GPT-3.5 | $0.001-0.003 | $1-3 |
| GPT-4 | $0.01-0.03 | $10-30 |
| Claude | $0.008-0.024 | $8-24 |
| Local LLM | Free | Free |

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Use Sampling**: Don't evaluate everything
   - Evaluate 10% of production content
   - Focus on high-risk content

2. **Choose Models Wisely**:
   - GPT-3.5 for development/testing
   - GPT-4 for production/critical
   - Local models for high volume

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Group evaluations together
   - Run during off-peak hours

4. **Smart Caching**:
   - Store evaluation results
   - Re-use for similar content
