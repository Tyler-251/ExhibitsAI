## Introduction

### What is a Chatbook?

A Chatbook is your personal content archive - a portable file that contains your conversations, notes, characters, and other content from the tldw_server platform. Think of it as a comprehensive backup or a way to share curated collections of your work.

### Why Use Chatbooks?

- **Backup & Recovery**: Protect your valuable content from data loss
- **Migration**: Move content between servers or accounts
- **Sharing**: Share curated collections with colleagues or friends
- **Organization**: Archive completed projects or research
- **Version Control**: Maintain snapshots of your content at specific points in time
- **Compliance**: Meet data retention or portability requirements

### What Can Be Included?

Chatbooks can contain:
- 💬 **Conversations**: Chat histories and message threads
- 📝 **Notes**: Personal notes and documentation
- 👤 **Characters**: AI character definitions and personalities
- 🌍 **World Books**: Lore and context for creative projects
- 📚 **Dictionaries**: Text replacement rules
- 📄 **Documents**: Generated summaries and reports
- 🎨 **Media**: Images, audio, and video files (optional)
- 🔢 **Embeddings**: Vector representations for search (optional)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using Chatbooks, ensure you have:
1. An active account on the tldw_server platform
2. Authentication credentials (API token or login)
3. Sufficient quota for export/import operations (check your tier)

### Understanding File Format

Chatbooks use the `.chatbook` extension and are essentially ZIP archives containing:
- `manifest.json`: Metadata about the chatbook
- `content/`: Directory containing exported content
- `media/`: Directory containing media files (if included)
- `README.md`: Human-readable description

## Exporting Content

### Quick Export (Everything)

To export all your content:

1. Navigate to the Chatbooks section
2. Click "Create New Export"
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Complete Backup - January 2024")
4. Add a description for future reference
5. Leave content selections empty (exports everything)
6. Click "Export"

### Selective Export

For more control over what to export:

1. **Select Content Types**: Choose which types to include
   - Conversations
   - Notes
   - Characters
   - World Books
   - Dictionaries

2. **Select Specific Items**:
   - Click "Select Items" for each content type
   - Use checkboxes to choose individual items
   - Or leave empty to include all items of that type

3. **Configure Options**:
   - **Include Media**: Adds images, audio, video (increases file size)
   - **Media Quality**:
     - `thumbnail`: Smallest size, preview quality
     - `compressed`: Balanced size and quality (recommended)
     - `original`: Full quality, largest size
   - **Include Embeddings**: Adds vector data for search (technical users)
   - **Include Generated Content**: Adds AI-generated documents

4. **Add Metadata**:
   - **Author**: Your name or username
   - **Tags**: Keywords for organization (e.g., "research", "project-x")
   - **Categories**: Broader classifications (e.g., "work", "personal")

### Export Modes

#### Synchronous Export (Small Collections)
- Best for: Small exports (<100 items)
- Behavior: Waits for completion, returns file immediately
- Set: `async_mode: false`

#### Asynchronous Export (Large Collections)
- Best for: Large exports or when you don't want to wait
- Behavior: Returns job ID, processes in background
- Set: `async_mode: true`
- Monitor progress via job status endpoint

### Example Export Scenarios

#### Weekly Backup
```json
{
  "name": "Weekly Backup - Week 4",
  "description": "Regular weekly backup of all content",
  "content_selections": {},  // Empty = everything
  "tags": ["backup", "weekly", "automatic"]
}
```

#### Project Archive
```json
{
  "name": "Project Alpha - Final",
  "description": "Complete archive of Project Alpha conversations and notes",
  "content_selections": {
    "conversation": ["conv_alpha_1", "conv_alpha_2"],
    "note": ["note_alpha_summary", "note_alpha_report"]
  },
  "include_media": true,
  "tags": ["project-alpha", "completed", "2024"]
}
```

#### Research Collection
```json
{
  "name": "AI Research Papers Discussion",
  "description": "Conversations about recent AI papers",
  "content_selections": {
    "conversation": [],  // All conversations
    "note": []  // All notes
  },
  "include_generated_content": true,
  "categories": ["research", "ai"]
}
```

## Importing Chatbooks

### Basic Import

1. Click "Import Chatbook"
2. Select your `.chatbook` file
3. Choose conflict resolution strategy
4. Click "Import"

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

When importing content that already exists:

#### Skip (Default)
- **Behavior**: Ignores items that already exist
- **Use When**: You want to avoid duplicates
- **Example**: Importing a backup when some content still exists

#### Overwrite
- **Behavior**: Replaces existing items with imported versions
- **Use When**: Imported version is more recent or authoritative
- **Example**: Restoring from a backup after data corruption

#### Rename
- **Behavior**: Adds imported items with modified names
- **Use When**: You want to keep both versions
- **Example**: Importing content from another user
- **Result**: "My Note" becomes "My Note (Imported)"

#### Merge (Future Feature)
- **Behavior**: Intelligently combines content
- **Use When**: Both versions have valuable changes
- **Status**: Coming soon

### Import Options

- **Prefix Imported**: Adds prefix to all imported item names
  - Example: "Research Note" becomes "[Imported] Research Note"
  - Useful for identifying imported content

- **Import Media**: Include media files from the chatbook
  - Default: true (recommended)
  - Set to false to save space

- **Import Embeddings**: Include vector embeddings
  - Default: false (recreated as needed)
  - Set to true for exact search behavior

### Preview Before Import

Always preview a chatbook before importing:

1. Click "Preview Chatbook"
2. Select the file
3. Review:
   - Total items by type
   - Creation date
   - Author information
   - Size
4. Decide on import strategy

## Managing Jobs

### Monitoring Export Jobs

For async exports, monitor progress:

1. Navigate to "Export Jobs"
2. Find your job by ID or name
3. Check status:
   - `pending`: Waiting to start
   - `in_progress`: Currently processing
   - `completed`: Ready for download
   - `failed`: Error occurred
   - `cancelled`: Manually stopped

### Job Details Include

- **Progress Percentage**: How much is complete
- **Items Processed**: X of Y items done
- **Time Elapsed**: How long it's been running
- **Estimated Time Remaining**: When it might finish
- **Error Messages**: If something went wrong

### Downloading Completed Exports

1. Wait for status: `completed`
2. Click "Download" button
3. Save file to secure location
4. Verify file integrity

### Cancelling Jobs

To cancel a running job:
1. Find job in list
2. Click "Cancel" button
3. Confirm cancellation
4. Note: Partial exports are not saved

## Best Practices

### Backup Strategy

1. **Regular Backups**: Weekly or monthly full exports
2. **Project Archives**: Export completed projects
3. **Before Major Changes**: Export before bulk operations
4. **3-2-1 Rule**:
   - 3 copies of important data
   - 2 different storage media
   - 1 offsite backup

### Organization Tips

1. **Naming Convention**:
   - Include date: "Backup_2024-01-15"
   - Include purpose: "ProjectX_Final"
   - Include version: "Research_v2"

2. **Use Tags Effectively**:
   - Type tags: "backup", "archive", "share"
   - Time tags: "2024", "january", "week-4"
   - Project tags: "project-x", "research", "personal"

3. **Description Best Practices**:
   - Include what's included
   - Note why it was created
   - Mention any exclusions
   - Add relevant dates

### Performance Optimization

1. **Large Exports**:
   - Use async mode
   - Export during off-peak hours
   - Exclude media if not needed
   - Split into multiple smaller exports

2. **Selective Exports**:
   - Export only what you need
   - Use date filters (when available)
   - Exclude generated content if regeneratable

3. **Import Optimization**:
   - Preview first to understand contents
   - Use "skip" for faster imports
   - Import during low-activity periods

### Security Recommendations

1. **Storage**:
   - Encrypt sensitive chatbooks
   - Store in secure locations
   - Don't share publicly
   - Use cloud storage with encryption

2. **Sharing**:
   - Review contents before sharing
   - Remove sensitive information
   - Use secure transfer methods
   - Set expiration dates

3. **Retention**:
   - Delete old exports regularly
   - Keep only necessary backups
   - Use cleanup endpoint for expired files

## Troubleshooting
