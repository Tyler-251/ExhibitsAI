# TTS Module Production Readiness Refactoring - Phase 3

## Overview
This document tracks the current refactoring effort to make the TTS module production-ready based on comprehensive code review and assessment.

## Current Status: **PHASE 1 & 2 COMPLETE** ✅

### Assessment Results: **NOT PRODUCTION READY** ⚠️

Based on comprehensive review, the TTS module has significant issues that prevent production deployment:

- **Architecture**: Good adapter pattern design, but incomplete implementations
- **Security**: Missing input validation and sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent across providers, no standardized exceptions
- **Resource Management**: No proper cleanup for streaming operations
- **Testing**: Limited coverage, missing integration tests
- **Configuration**: Dual config systems need unification

- [ ] Create alerting thresholds
- [ ] Performance metrics collection

### Phase 4: Production Hardening (1-2 days)
**Status: 0% Complete**

#### 4.1 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Add response caching for repeated requests
- [ ] Implement request batching where possible
- [ ] Add connection keep-alive for APIs
- [ ] Memory optimization for local models

#### 4.2 Documentation & Operations
- [ ] Create runbook for common issues
- [ ] Document all configuration options
- [ ] Add provider setup guides
- [ ] Create performance tuning guide

#### 4.3 Security Hardening
- [ ] Add rate limiting per API key
- [ ] Implement request signing/validation
- [ ] Add audit logging for all operations
- [ ] Security testing and validation

### Phase 5: Final Validation (1 day)
**Status: 0% Complete**

#### 5.1 End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Test all providers in production-like environment
- [ ] Verify failover scenarios work correctly
- [ ] Load test with expected production traffic

#### 5.2 Code Cleanup
- [ ] Remove all OLD_* files after verification
- [ ] Clean up TODO comments
- [ ] Update all documentation

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. **`tts_exceptions.py`** - Comprehensive exception hierarchy for standardized error handling
2. **`tts_validation.py`** - Input validation and sanitization for security and data integrity
3. **`tts_resource_manager.py`** - Resource management for connections, memory, and streaming sessions

### Files To Be Modified:
- `tts_service_v2.py` - Integrate new exceptions and validation
- `circuit_breaker.py` - Complete implementation, remove TODOs
- `adapter_registry.py` - Add validation integration
- `adapters/*.py` - Standardize error handling with new exceptions
- `audio.py` - Integrate validation at API endpoint level

### Files To Be Removed:
- All `OLD_*.py` files after verification of V2 functionality

## Critical Issues Identified & Status

- [ ] Standardized error handling across all components
- [ ] Proper resource management and cleanup
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] All adapters fully functional or removed
- [ ] Complete operational documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established

## Next Actions

1. **Complete Remaining Adapter Updates** - Update Higgs, Dia, Chatterbox, and VibeVoice adapters with new systems
2. **Integrate with Service Layer** - Update tts_service_v2.py to use new exceptions and validation
3. **Update API Endpoints** - Integrate validation and error handling in audio.py endpoint
4. **Add Comprehensive Tests** - Create tests for new exception hierarchy, validation, and resource management
5. **Configuration Unification** - Consolidate YAML and config.txt systems
6. **Remove Legacy Code** - Clean up OLD_* files after verification

## Notes

- Architecture is sound with good adapter pattern design
- Security concerns addressed with comprehensive validation system
- Error handling standardized with proper exception hierarchy
- Resource management implemented with memory monitoring and connection pooling
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Test coverage is essentially non-existent for new systems
- **FIXED**: Removed fictional "vibes" feature from VibeVoice adapter
- Focus should be on testing and configuration management
