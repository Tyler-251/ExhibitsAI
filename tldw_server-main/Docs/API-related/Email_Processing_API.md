# Email Processing API

This guide documents email support in the media API. It covers the processing-only endpoint (`/process-emails`) and how to ingest emails via `/media/add` for persistence.

## Overview

- Supported format: `.eml` (RFC 822). Attachments are enumerated in metadata; attached `.eml` files can be parsed recursively when enabled.
- The parser extracts plain-text and HTML (HTML is converted to text if no plain-text part exists), headers, addresses, and attachments metadata. No raw attachment bytes are stored.

## Processing Only

- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/media/process-emails`
- Purpose: Extract content and metadata from uploaded `.eml` files, optionally chunk and analyze, without writing to the database.

Request (multipart/form-data)
- Field `files`: one or more `.eml` files. When `accept_archives=true` is provided, a `.zip` archive of `.eml` files is also accepted. When `accept_mbox=true` is provided, a `.mbox` mailbox is accepted. When `accept_pst=true` is provided, a `.pst`/`.ost` container is accepted (feature flag; parsing requires external tools).
- Options (form fields):
  - `perform_chunking`: bool (default true)
  - `chunk_method`: one of `sentences|paragraphs|…` (default `sentences`)
  - `chunk_size`: int (default 1000)
  - `chunk_overlap`: int (default 200)
  - `accept_archives`: bool (default false). When true and a `.zip` file is uploaded, member `.eml` files are expanded and processed as individual results.
  - `accept_mbox`: bool (default false). When true and a `.mbox` file is uploaded, messages are expanded and processed as individual results.
  - `accept_pst`: bool (default false). When true and a `.pst`/`.ost` file is uploaded, the request is accepted under a feature flag. When `pypff`/`libpff` is installed, messages are expanded and processed as individual results; otherwise the API returns an informative error.
  - `ingest_attachments`: bool (default false). When true, recursively parse attached `.eml` files and include them in the response under `children` (still no DB persistence in this endpoint).
  - `max_depth`: int (default 2)
  - `title`, `author`, `keywords`, `custom_prompt`, `system_prompt`, `perform_analysis`, `api_name`, `summarize_recursively` (optional analysis controls)

Response (200 or 207)
- `results`: list of per-file result objects. Each includes:
  - `status`: `Success|Warning|Error`
  - `media_type`: `email`
  - `metadata`: includes `title`, `author`, `filename`, `parser_used`, and `email` object with fields:
    - `from`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc`, `subject`, `date`, `message_id`, `format`, `attachments` (name, content_type, size, content_id, disposition), `headers_map`
  - `content`: extracted plain text
  - `chunks`: list when chunking is enabled
  - `children`: present when `ingest_attachments=true` and attached `.eml` are parsed

  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/media/process-emails
```

PST/OST container (feature-flag; accepted with informative error until configured):

  -F "files=@/path/to/mail.pst;type=application/octet-stream" \
  -F "accept_pst=true" \
  -F "perform_chunking=true" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/media/process-emails
```

## Ingest and Persist

- Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/media/add`
- Behavior: When `media_type=email`, the uploaded `.eml` is processed via the email parser and persisted to the database with versioning, keywords, and chunk metadata.

Form fields (in addition to common `/media/add` fields)
- `media_type`: `email`
- `accept_archives`: bool (default false). When true, allows uploading a `.zip` of `.eml` files; each child email is expanded and processed.
- `accept_mbox`: bool (default false). When true, allows uploading a `.mbox` mailbox; each message is expanded and processed.
    - `accept_pst`: bool (default false). When true, allows uploading a `.pst`/`.ost` container. With `pypff`/`libpff` installed, messages are expanded and processed; otherwise, the API returns an informative error.
- `ingest_attachments`: bool (default false). When true, attached `.eml` files are parsed recursively and added as separate child media items.
- `max_depth`: int (default 2) - recursion depth for child `.eml` parsing.

Chunking defaults for emails
- If not overridden by the client, `/media/add` aligns chunk size to 1000 and overlap to 150 for emails.
- The processing-only endpoint defaults overlap to 200; this is by design to keep `/add` email behavior slightly more compact.

Parent/child linkage and grouping
- When `ingest_attachments=true` creates children, each child is persisted with a `parent_media_uuid` in safe metadata.
- A grouping keyword `email_group:<Message-ID>` is applied to the parent (and inherited by children via keyword set) to make UI grouping easy.
- The `/media/add` response for the parent includes `child_db_results` summarizing each child’s DB insert (`db_id`, `media_uuid`, `title`).

ZIP archives behavior
- When `accept_archives=true` with a `.zip` upload, each member `.eml` is processed as a separate child email.
- Each child result includes a grouping keyword `email_archive:<zip_file_stem>`.
- The synthetic parent (the ZIP) is not persisted; the response contains `children` (results) and `child_db_results` (DB insert summaries for children).

MBOX behavior
- When `accept_mbox=true` with a `.mbox` upload, each message is processed as a separate child email.
- Each child result includes a grouping keyword `email_mbox:<mbox_file_stem>`.
- The synthetic parent (the MBOX) is not persisted; the response contains `children` (results) and `child_db_results` (DB insert summaries for children).

PST/OST behavior (feature-flag)
- When `accept_pst=true` with a `.pst`/`.ost` upload, the request is accepted under a feature flag.
- With `pypff` (libpff) installed, messages are expanded and processed like MBOX, with guardrails and grouping `email_pst:<pst_file_stem>`.
- Without `pypff`, the API returns a single informative error result; grouping keyword is still included for filtering.

Limitations
- Only `.eml` is supported in this version. `.msg` and `.p7m` are not yet enabled via the API.
- `.zip` uploads are only accepted when `accept_archives=true` and only member `.eml` files are processed (others ignored). Archive limits (max files and uncompressed size) are enforced.
- `.mbox` uploads are only accepted when `accept_mbox=true`; message count and size limits are enforced.
- `.pst`/`.ost` uploads are only accepted when `accept_pst=true`; full parsing requires `pypff`/`libpff`.
- Attachments other than `.eml` are not ingested as separate media by default (metadata only).
- HTML is converted to text using `html2text` when available; otherwise a simple tag strip is used.

Future formats (planned)
- PST/OST: enhanced parsing options (attachments, recipients) and optional `readpst` integration.

## Testing
- All tests: `python -m pytest -v`
- Email tests only: `python -m pytest -v -k "email"`
- Coverage: `python -m pytest --cov=tldw_Server_API --cov-report=term-missing`
