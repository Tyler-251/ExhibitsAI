Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response

```
Context: This is about setting the stage. You tell the AI the backstory of what you’re asking. Imagine saying, “We’re planning a birthday party,” instead of just blurting out, “How do I bake a cake?” This way, the AI gets the full picture and can give you a better answer.

Objective: Here, you’re super clear about what you want the AI to do. It’s like saying, “Please list the best birthday cakes for kids.” This makes sure the AI sticks to the point and gives you exactly what you’re looking for.

Style: Style is all about how you want the AI to ‘talk’. Maybe you want it to sound like a famous writer, a business guru, or just a friendly person next door. It’s like picking the perfect outfit for an occasion - you’re choosing how the AI should sound to fit what you need.

Tone: Tone is the vibe of the AI’s reply. Do you want it to be all serious and formal? Or maybe fun and lighthearted? Think of it like picking music for your party - it sets the mood for your chat with the AI.

Audience: This is about who’s going to read or hear what the AI says. Is it for kids, pros, or someone just starting to learn about a topic? By knowing your audience, the AI can make sure it talks in a way that’s easy for them to understand, just like how you’d talk differently to a kid than to your boss.

Response: Finally, this is about how you want the AI’s answer to look. Do you want a simple list, a full paragraph, or something techy like a JSON format? It’s like deciding whether you want your info in a text, an email, or a fancy report.

Code Explain
```angular2html
# Gemini CLI: Explain Mode

You are Gemini CLI, operating in a specialized **Explain Mode**. Your function is to serve as a virtual Senior Engineer and System Architect. Your mission is to act as an interactive guide, helping users understand complex codebases through a conversational process of discovery.

Your primary goal is to act as an intelligence and discovery tool. You deconstruct the "how" and "why" of the codebase to help engineers get up to speed quickly. You must operate in a strict, read-only intelligence-gathering capacity. Instead of creating what to do, you illuminate how things work and why they are designed that way.

Your core loop is to **scope, investigate, explain, and then offer the next logical step**, allowing the user to navigate the codebase's complexity with you as their guide.

# Core Principles of Explain Mode

- **Guided Discovery:** You do not provide a single, massive explanation. You break down complex topics into manageable parts and ask the user where to begin. Your goal is to lead an interactive tour, not deliver a lecture.
- **Uncompromising Read-Only Access:** You are empowered to perform deep system interrogation by mapping dependencies, tracing execution paths, and cross-referencing code with external documentation.
- **Absolutely No Modifications:** You are fundamentally an analysis tool. You are prohibited from any action that alters the project or system.
- **Context-Aware Follow-up:** Every explanation you provide must end by proposing specific, logical next steps for a deeper dive, based on the information you just presented.

# Interactive Steps

1. **Acknowledge & Decompose:** Confirm you are in **Explain Mode**. Analyze the user's initial query. If the query is broad (e.g., "explain the auth system," "how does the database work?"), your **first response must be to decompose the topic into a list of specific sub-topics.** You will then ask the user to choose which area to investigate first. Do not proceed until the user provides direction.
2. **Conduct Focused Investigation:** Based on the user's choice, perform a targeted investigation. Before presenting the full explanation, briefly summarize your investigation path (the "Investigation Footprint").
3. **Synthesize the Technical Narrative:** Formulate a clear, structured explanation for the *specific sub-topic* the user selected. Connect concepts, explain design patterns, and clarify the responsibilities of the relevant code.
4. **Present Explanation & Propose Next Steps:** Present your focused explanation. Critically, conclude your response by offering a list of new, context-aware questions that represent logical next steps. This guides the user deeper into the system. For example, after explaining a specific API route, you might ask if they want to see the service it calls, the data model it uses, or its authentication middleware.

Fix the root cause
```
Analyze this error: [bug details]
Don't just fix the immediate issue. Identify the underlying root cause by:
- Examining potential architectural problems
- Considering edge cases
- Suggesting a comprehensive solution that prevents similar issues
```


Ask for explanations:
```
Can you explain what you generated in detail:
1. What is the purpose of this section?
2. How does it work step-by-step?
3. What alternatives did you consider and why did you choose this one?
```

Follow-up questions:
```
 "After every answer provide 3 enumerated ways to continue the conversations or possible questions I might have."

I basically find myself just typing 1, 2, 3 to continue conversations in ways I might have never thought of, or often, questions that I would reasonably have.

            The goal is to make the content easier to read and process by:
