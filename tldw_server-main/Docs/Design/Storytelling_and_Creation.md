# Storytelling & Creation



### Link Dump:
Multi-prompt storytelling:
    Start with a prompt, and then continue the story with additional prompts.
    Fork from any prompt to fork/branch the story.
    Prompts can be edited, and the story can be continued from any point.
    Prompts can be submitted to multiple APIs for selection of the best response.
