I have been assigned by management to take over this project. I spoke with the prior project owner but have not reviewed the code for correctness/best practices.
  I was told it was a project by multiple teams over 2 years. It is now my responsibility to tighten things up, ensure documentation is correct/up-to-date, and
  bring it up to production standards.

  I am going through module by module, and for this session, I want to focus on the X Module.

  Help me by going through it an reviewing it as described.
